# 🧠 MySQL 20-Day Interview Challenge (150+ Questions)

Welcome to my **MySQL 20-Day Interview Challenge** 🚀  
I designed this challenge to build deep practical SQL skills and prepare for **Data Analyst / Business Analyst interviews**.  
The goal is to solve **150+ real-world and interview-standard SQL problems** across **20 days** — tracking every single one here.
